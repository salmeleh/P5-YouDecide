Purpose: find a calendar of events at local music venues

The user inputs a zip code and this will start a search on song kick for venues in the corresponding city. A list of venues is displayed with their street addresses. Selecting a venue will download a table of the upcoming events at that venue. Clicking on a specific event will launch safari to view the SongKick event page.

The user is able to go back and select a new venue in order to see its upcoming events. A new zip code search can be started and this will display the new venues.
